# Mid-bootcamp-project

For this project, I wanted to find out what would make a book well rated.\
I chose this topic because I think it speaks to everyone, as everyone has read a book at least once in their life. I love to read, so I was curious to know which books might be the most popular and why.\
For this project, I used a dataset from the goodreads.com website which is the world’s largest site for readers and book recommendations since 2007.\
